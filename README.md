# top-10

Choose your top 10 something!
I use it to order my top 10 games list. :)

## Installation

Download the latest jar from [here](https://github.com/caiorulli/top-10/releases).
You will need Java installed to run it.

## Usage

To start a top 10 ranking, think of all possible items first.
If you are writing a top 10 games like me, think up of many good games you have played through the years.
Then, write them down in a CSV in the same folder as the jar. They should each fill a line, as in the [example](https://github.com/caiorulli/top-10/blob/master/sample.csv).
If you've named it `games.csv`, then run:

```bash
java -jar top-10-<version>-standalone.jar games.csv
```
    
You will be repeatedly prompted to choose between one of random two entries.
After each result, the software will update the ratings using the [ELO Rating](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elo-rating-algorithm/).
You will also be able to save your progress into a local `results.csv` file and finish the session printing the resulting Top 10.

```bash
Which of these games is better?
1) Game A
2) Game B
3) Save and print top 10
```

Later on, you can reload the saved progress by running the program without arguments.

```bash
java -jar top-10-<version>-standalone.jar
```

That's about it. Have fun!
